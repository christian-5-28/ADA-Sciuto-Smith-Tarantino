# A Title
Boring but descriptive or more catchy?  
* The Tweeting Trump  
* Trump's Twitter Fingers  
* Analysing Trump's Tweets?  

# Abstract
_A 150 word description of the project idea, goals, dataset used. What story you would like to tell and why? What's the motivation behind your project?_



# Research questions
_A list of research questions you would like to address during the project._ 

Note: These need to be fairly specific questions.  

* Word usage and type of tweet in three periods:
    * Before presidential candidacy announcement, first tweet to 16/06/2015.  
    * Before election, 16/06/2015 to 8/11/2016.  
    * After election, 8/11/2016 to now.  

* Change in word usage and/or rethoric in relation to poll results.

* Change in word usage and/or rethoric in relation to major events and scandals.
  E.g. Panama Papers, Clinton e-mails, and so on.

* Word usage and rethoric comparison with other politicians, e.g. Clinton, Obama, republican nominee opponents.

* Analyse his retweets and replies.  
  E.g. while he mostly retweet right-wing content (true?), does he reply to users from both sides of the political spectum?  
  How does the word usage in his replies differ from his normal tweets?


# Dataset
_List the dataset(s) you want to use, and some ideas on how do you expect to get, manage, process and enrich it/them. Show us you've read the docs and some examples, and you've a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant._

###### Main Dataset  
*[Trump Twitter Archive](https://github.com/bpb27/trump_tweet_data_archive)*  
Size ~2GB. Updated hourly. We will probably use the condensed version of the tweet data. But we will also at least take a look at the full version and see if we can extract some extra information from it.

###### Supporting Datasets
This list is not final and might grow or shrink as the project progresses.  

* Panama Papers [add links] 
* Obama Tweets  
* Clinton Tweets
